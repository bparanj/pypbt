## Install Python using pyenv

On Mac:

```
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install pyenv
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Check version:

```
$ pyenv
pyenv 2.3.35
```

Install Python 3.12.1:

```
$ pyenv install 3.12.1
```

Verify installation:

```
$ pyenv versions
* system (set by /Users/bparanj/.pyenv/version)
  3.12.1
```

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.1
```

## Python Virtual Environment

To set up a Python virtual environment on a Mac using `pyenv`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure `pyenv` is Installed and Configured**:
   - Make sure `pyenv` is correctly installed and initialized in your shell. You can check this by running:
     ```bash
     pyenv --version
     ```

2. **Install the Desired Python Version (if not already installed)**:
   - List all available Python versions with:
     ```bash
     pyenv install --list
     ```
   - Install the version you need (for example, Python 3.8.6):
     ```bash
     pyenv install 3.8.6
     ```

3. **Set the Local Python Version**:
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Set the local Python version to the one you installed:
     ```bash
     pyenv local 3.12.1
     ```

4. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - You can use `python -m venv` to create a virtual environment. First, ensure the local Python version is active:
     ```bash
     pyenv which python
     ```
		 Output:
		 ```
		 /Users/bparanj/.pyenv/versions/3.12.1/bin/python
		 ```
   - Create the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
     Here, `venv` is the name of the virtual environment directory; you can name it whatever you prefer.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Activate the virtual environment using:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Once activated, your shell prompt will usually change to indicate that you're in the virtual environment.

6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   - When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

7. **Using the Virtual Environment**:
   - While the virtual environment is active, any Python packages you install using `pip` will be isolated to this environment.

Each time you start a new terminal session and want to work in the virtual environment, you'll need to activate it again with the `source venv/bin/activate` command from the project directory. This setup allows you to manage dependencies and Python versions on a per-project basis effectively.

## Cleanup

Run the commands to remove any old versions of Python by looking at the output of running brew.

```
rm '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/attr/__init__.py'
```

## Update Xcode

Update to version 15:

```
xcode-select --install
```

The popup window can be hidden if you have too many windows open.

Verify compiler version:

```
 gcc --version
Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin23.1.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

## Instructions to Update Path  

```
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/bparanj/.bash_profile

For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/include"

For pkg-config to find ruby you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib/pkgconfig"
	
If you need to have libpq first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/bparanj/.bash_profile

For compilers to find libpq you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/include"

For pkg-config to find libpq you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/lib/pkgconfig"
	
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/bparanj/.bash_profile

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/include"

For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"
```
