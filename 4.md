## Distribution of Generated Entries

In the Hypothesis library for Python, you can use the `@given` decorator along with the `event` function from the `hypothesis` module to check the distribution of generated entries in a test run.

The `event` function is used to record that something of interest happened during the execution of a test. You can use it to record the occurrence of different types of generated entries. After the test run, you can use the `hypothesis.statistics` function to print the statistics, which will include the distribution of the events.

Here is an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, event
from hypothesis.statistics import note

@given(st.integers())
def test_distribution(x):
    if x < 0:
        event("Negative number")
    elif x == 0:
        event("Zero")
    else:
        event("Positive number")

test_distribution()
```

After running the test, you can use the `hypothesis.statistics` function to print the statistics:

```python
import hypothesis

hypothesis.statistics(test_distribution)
```

This will print the distribution of the events, which in this case are the types of integers generated by the test.

## Random Test Data with Specific Distributions

In Hypothesis, you can use the `strategies` module to generate random test data with specific distributions. Here are some examples:

1. **Uniform distribution**: All values in the specified range have an equal chance of being chosen.

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
def test_uniform_distribution(x):
    assert 0 <= x <= 100
```

2. **Normal (Gaussian) distribution**: Values are distributed in a bell curve around a mean value.

Hypothesis doesn't directly support generating values with a normal distribution. However, you can generate multiple uniform values and add them together to approximate a normal distribution (central limit theorem).

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), min_size=10, max_size=10))
def test_approx_normal_distribution(lst):
    x = sum(lst) / len(lst)
    assert 0 <= x <= 100
```

3. **Custom distribution**: You can define a custom strategy using `st.sampled_from` and `st.frequencies`.

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.sampled_from(['a', 'b', 'c']).filter(lambda x: x != 'b'))
def test_custom_distribution(x):
    assert x in ['a', 'c']

@given(st.frequencies([(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]))
def test_custom_distribution_with_weights(x):
    assert x in ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

In the first custom distribution example, 'a', 'b', and 'c' are equally likely, but 'b' is filtered out. In the second example, 'c' is three times as likely as 'a', and 'b' is twice as likely as 'a'.

## Apply a Regular Function to a Strategy

In the Hypothesis library for Python, you can use the `.map()` method to apply a regular Python function to a strategy (which is Hypothesis's term for a generator). This will create a new strategy that generates values by generating a value from the original strategy and then applying the function to it.

Here is an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Define a function to modify the generated value
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Apply the function to a strategy
squared_integers = st.integers().map(square)

@given(squared_integers)
def test_squared_integers(x):
    assert x >= 0
```

In this example, the `square` function is applied to the `st.integers()` strategy to create a new strategy that generates squared integers. The `@given` decorator is then used to apply this strategy to a test function.

## Modify a Strategy

In the Hypothesis library for Python, you can use the `map()` method to apply a function to the values generated by a strategy. This will create a new strategy that generates values by generating a value from the original strategy and then applying the function to it.

Here is an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Define a function to modify the generated value
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Apply the function to a strategy
squared_integers = st.integers().map(square)

@given(squared_integers)
def test_squared_integers(x):
    assert x >= 0
```

In this example, the `square` function is applied to the `st.integers()` strategy to create a new strategy that generates squared integers. The `@given` decorator is then used to apply this strategy to a test function. This test will now receive squared integers as input.

## Lazy Macro

In Hypothesis for Python, the equivalent of the `?LAZY` macro in PropEr (used in Elixir's PropCheck) is the `deferred()` function. 

The `deferred()` function is used to define recursive and mutually recursive strategies. It allows you to reference a strategy that hasn't been defined yet, which is useful when the strategy refers to itself.

Here's an example of how you might use `deferred()` to define a strategy for generating binary trees:

```python
from hypothesis import strategies as st

# A binary tree is either an empty tree, or a node with two child trees.
binary_tree = st.deferred(lambda: st.one_of(
    st.tuples(),
    st.tuples(st.integers(), binary_tree, binary_tree)
))
```

In this example, `binary_tree` is a strategy that generates either an empty tuple (representing an empty tree), or a tuple containing an integer and two child trees. The `deferred()` function is used to allow `binary_tree` to refer to itself in its own definition.

## Sized Macro

In Hypothesis for Python, the equivalent of the `?SIZED` macro in PropEr (used in Elixir's PropCheck) is the `recursive()` function.

The `recursive()` function is used to define recursive strategies. It takes a base strategy and a function that, given a strategy, returns another strategy. It then combines these in a recursive manner to produce the final strategy.

Here's an example of how you might use `recursive()` to define a strategy for generating nested lists of integers:

```python
from hypothesis import strategies as st

nested_lists = st.recursive(
    st.integers(),  # The base case is just an integer
    lambda children: st.lists(children),  # Given a strategy, return a new strategy that generates lists of it
)
```

In this example, `nested_lists` is a strategy that generates nested lists of integers. The depth and complexity of the generated lists is controlled by Hypothesis based on the size parameter, which is similar to the role of `?SIZED` in PropEr.

## Symbolic Generator

In the Hypothesis library for Python, there isn't a direct equivalent of a symbolic generator as seen in PropEr or PropCheck for Elixir. Hypothesis doesn't have built-in support for symbolic execution, which is a more advanced form of property-based testing where the test inputs are symbolic values rather than concrete ones.

However, Hypothesis does support generating complex data structures and has powerful capabilities for shrinking test cases to minimal failing examples, which can often achieve similar goals to symbolic execution.

For example, if you wanted to generate dictionaries with integer keys and values, you could do something like this:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.dictionaries(st.integers(), st.integers()))
def test_dict(d):
    assert isinstance(d, dict)
```

This will generate random dictionaries with integer keys and values, and Hypothesis will automatically try to find the smallest dictionary that causes the test to fail if it can find a failing case.

What in hypothesis in Pythan can be used for: that creates a file containing various bytes. When a property fails, the user should be able to see the failing output without having to peek inside files.

In Hypothesis for Python, you can use the `@example` decorator to provide specific inputs that cause a test to fail. This allows you to see the failing output directly in the test output, without having to peek inside files.

However, if you want to generate random bytes and use them as input to a test, you can use the `binary()` strategy. If the test fails, Hypothesis will automatically shrink the input to a minimal failing case and display it in the test output.

Here's an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.binary())
def test_bytes(b):
    # Your test here. If it fails, Hypothesis will display the failing input.
    assert isinstance(b, bytes)
```

In this example, the `test_bytes` function is a property-based test that takes a random sequence of bytes as input. If the test fails, Hypothesis will display the failing input in the test output.

If you want to write the bytes to a file as part of the test, you can do that inside the test function. However, the contents of the file won't be displayed in the test output if the test fails. To achieve that, you would need to read the contents of the file and include them in the assertion.

## Imposing Restrictions

In Hypothesis for Python, you can impose restrictions on default generators using several methods provided by the library. Here are a few examples:

1. **Filtering**: You can use the `filter()` method to impose a condition that all generated values must satisfy.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0))
def test_even_numbers(x):
    assert x % 2 == 0
```

In this example, the `filter()` method is used to ensure that the `integers()` strategy only generates even numbers.

2. **Bounding**: Many strategies allow you to specify bounds on the generated values.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
def test_bounded_numbers(x):
    assert 0 <= x <= 100
```

In this example, the `integers()` strategy is bounded to only generate numbers between 0 and 100.

3. **Mapping**: You can use the `map()` method to apply a function to all generated values.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers().map(abs))
def test_positive_numbers(x):
    assert x >= 0
```

In this example, the `map()` method is used to apply the `abs()` function to all numbers generated by the `integers()` strategy, ensuring that only positive numbers are generated.

These methods can be combined to create complex strategies that generate exactly the kind of data you need for your tests.

## Transforming Generators

In hypothesis in Python how do you deal with the need to generate data types that can’t be described with the basic Python data structures that default generators support?

In Hypothesis for Python, if you need to generate data types that can't be described with the basic Python data structures that default generators support, you can create custom strategies.

Here's an example of how you might create a custom strategy for generating instances of a custom class:

```python
from hypothesis import strategies as st

class CustomClass:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Define a strategy for generating instances of CustomClass
custom_class_strategy = st.builds(CustomClass, st.integers(), st.integers())

# Now you can use custom_class_strategy in your tests
@given(custom_class_strategy)
def test_custom_class(instance):
    assert isinstance(instance, CustomClass)
```

In this example, the `builds()` function is used to create a strategy that generates instances of `CustomClass`. The arguments to `builds()` are the class (or function) to be called, followed by strategies for each of the arguments to that call. In this case, `st.integers()` is used for both arguments, so `CustomClass` instances will be generated with random integer values for `x` and `y`.

You can also use `composite()` to build more complex strategies. The `composite()` decorator lets you combine other strategies in more complex ways. It takes a function that returns a strategy, and that function takes a `draw` argument that can be used to draw values from strategies.

```python
from hypothesis import strategies as st
from hypothesis.strategies import composite

@composite
def custom_class_strategy(draw):
    x = draw(st.integers())
    y = draw(st.integers())
    return CustomClass(x, y)

@given(custom_class_strategy())
def test_custom_class(instance):
    assert isinstance(instance, CustomClass)
```

In this example, the `custom_class_strategy` function uses the `draw` argument to draw random integers for `x` and `y`, and then returns a `CustomClass` instance with those values.

## Resizing Generators

In hypothesis in Python, how to make generators grow bigger: make an integer larger, a list longer, or a string have larger codepoints?

In Hypothesis for Python, the size and complexity of the data generated by a strategy is controlled by a "size" parameter that Hypothesis adjusts as testing proceeds. However, you don't have direct control over this parameter.

That said, you can influence the size and complexity of the generated data in a few ways:

1. **Bounding**: For strategies like `integers()`, `lists()`, and `text()`, you can specify a `min_value` or `min_size` to ensure that the generated data is at least a certain size.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=1000))
def test_large_integers(x):
    assert x >= 1000

@given(st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=100))
def test_long_lists(lst):
    assert len(lst) >= 100

@given(st.text(min_size=100))
def test_large_strings(s):
    assert len(s) >= 100
```

2. **Mapping and Flatmapping**: You can use the `map()` and `flatmap()` methods to transform the data generated by a strategy. For example, you could use `map()` to square the integers generated by an `integers()` strategy, or use `flatmap()` to generate a list of a length determined by a first strategy.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers().map(lambda x: x * x))
def test_squared_integers(x):
    assert x >= 0

@given(st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=100).flatmap(lambda n: st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=n, max_size=n)))
def test_lists_of_fixed_length(lst):
    assert len(lst) >= 1
```

In the second example, the `flatmap()` method is used to first generate an integer `n`, and then generate a list of length `n`.

Remember that Hypothesis is designed to find minimal failing examples, so it will try to shrink the size and complexity of failing test cases. If you need your test data to be of a certain size or complexity, it's usually best to specify that using the methods described above.

## Custom Generators

In hypothesis in Python, what are the basic building blocks of writing custom generators?

The basic building blocks for writing custom generators (also known as strategies) are:

1. **Primitive strategies**: These are the basic strategies provided by Hypothesis, such as `integers()`, `floats()`, `text()`, `lists()`, etc. They generate simple types of data.

2. **Combining strategies**: You can combine multiple strategies using functions like `one_of()`, `both()`, and `either()`. For example, `one_of(integers(), floats())` will generate either an integer or a float.

3. **Mapping and filtering**: You can use the `map()` method to apply a function to the data generated by a strategy, and the `filter()` method to only allow data that satisfies a certain condition. For example, `integers().map(lambda x: x * x)` will generate squared integers, and `integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)` will generate even integers.

4. **Building and compositing**: The `builds()` function can be used to generate instances of a custom class or call a function with arguments generated by other strategies. The `composite()` decorator can be used to define more complex strategies that involve drawing multiple values and combining them in some way.

Here's an example of how you might use these building blocks to define a custom strategy:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
from hypothesis.strategies import composite

class CustomClass:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

@composite
def custom_class_strategy(draw):
    x = draw(st.integers())
    y = draw(st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=1, max_size=10))
    return CustomClass(x, y)

@given(custom_class_strategy())
def test_custom_class(instance):
    assert isinstance(instance, CustomClass)
```

In this example, the `custom_class_strategy` function uses the `draw` argument to draw an integer and a list of integers, and then returns a `CustomClass` instance with those values.

## Gathering Statistics

In Hypothesis for Python, how to gather statistics?

In Hypothesis for Python, you can gather statistics about your tests using the `hypothesis.note()` function and the `@hypothesis.settings` decorator with the `show_statistics=True` option.

Here's an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings, note

@settings(show_statistics=True)
@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    if x < 0:
        note("Negative numbers")
    elif x > 0:
        note("Positive numbers")
    else:
        note("Zero")
    assert isinstance(x, int)
```

In this example, the `note()` function is used to record a piece of information about each test case. When the test is run, Hypothesis will display statistics about how many times each note was recorded.

The `show_statistics=True` option in the `@settings` decorator is necessary to make Hypothesis display these statistics. Without it, the notes will still be recorded, but the statistics won't be displayed.

The `note()` only records information for failing test cases. If you want to record information for all test cases, you can use the `event()` function instead. The usage is the same as `note()`, but `event()` records information for all test cases, not just failing ones.

## Collecting

In Hypothesis for Python, the equivalent of the `collect` function in Elixir's PropCheck is the `event()` function. The `event()` function is used to record that something of interest happened during a test run, and Hypothesis will then provide statistics about how often these events occurred.

Here's an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, event

@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    if x < 0:
        event("Negative numbers")
    elif x > 0:
        event("Positive numbers")
    else:
        event("Zero")
    assert isinstance(x, int)
```

In this example, the `event()` function is used to record whether the generated integer was negative, positive, or zero. When the test is run, Hypothesis will display statistics about how often each event occurred.

Please note that to see the statistics, you need to run Hypothesis in verbose mode. You can do this by setting the verbosity setting to `Verbosity.verbose`:

```python
from hypothesis import Verbosity, settings

@settings(verbosity=Verbosity.verbose)
@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    # ...
```

This will print out the statistics after the test run.

The `event()` function in Hypothesis allows you to gather statistics about specific events or conditions that occur during your tests. However, it doesn't directly gather the values of a specific metric, but rather counts the occurrences of events.

If you want to gather statistics about the values of a specific metric, you can use the `event()` function to record different ranges or categories of values. For example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, event

@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    if x < 0:
        event("Negative numbers")
    elif x > 0:
        event("Positive numbers")
    else:
        event("Zero")
    assert isinstance(x, int)
```

In this example, the `event()` function is used to record whether the generated integer was negative, positive, or zero. When the test is run, Hypothesis will display statistics about how often each event occurred.

To see the statistics, you need to run Hypothesis in verbose mode. You can do this by setting the verbosity setting to `Verbosity.verbose`:

```python
from hypothesis import Verbosity, settings

@settings(verbosity=Verbosity.verbose)
@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    # ...
```

This will print out the statistics after the test run.

## Aggregating

In Hypothesis for Python, the equivalent of the `aggregate()` function in Elixir's PropCheck is the `event()` function. The `event()` function is used to record that something of interest happened during a test run, and Hypothesis will then provide statistics about how often these events occurred.

However, unlike `aggregate()` in PropCheck, `event()` in Hypothesis does not allow you to group events into categories. Instead, each call to `event()` with a different argument is considered a separate event.

Here's an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, event

@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    if x < 0:
        event("Negative numbers")
    elif x > 0:
        event("Positive numbers")
    else:
        event("Zero")
    assert isinstance(x, int)
```

In this example, the `event()` function is used to record whether the generated integer was negative, positive, or zero. When the test is run, Hypothesis will display statistics about how often each event occurred.

Please note that to see the statistics, you need to run Hypothesis in verbose mode. You can do this by setting the verbosity setting to `Verbosity.verbose`:

```python
from hypothesis import Verbosity, settings

@settings(verbosity=Verbosity.verbose)
@given(st.integers())
def test_integers(x):
    # ...
```

This will print out the statistics after the test run.

## Changing Probabilities

In Hypothesis for Python, what gives us control over data generation is having the ability to tweak the probabilities of how data is generated?

In Hypothesis for Python, you don't have direct control over the probabilities of how data is generated. Hypothesis uses a technique called Conjecture to generate test cases, which is designed to find edge cases in your code. It doesn't provide a way to directly tweak the probabilities of different values being generated.

However, you can influence the data generation process in a few ways:

1. **Use specific strategies**: Hypothesis provides a wide range of strategies for generating data. For example, if you want to generate integers, you can use the `integers()` strategy. If you want to generate text, you can use the `text()` strategy. Each strategy has its own parameters that you can tweak to influence the data that's generated.

2. **Filtering**: You can use the `filter()` method to only allow data that satisfies a certain condition. For example, `integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)` will generate even integers.

3. **Mapping and Flatmapping**: You can use the `map()` and `flatmap()` methods to transform the data generated by a strategy. For example, you could use `map()` to square the integers generated by an `integers()` strategy, or use `flatmap()` to generate a list of a length determined by a first strategy.

4. **Combining strategies**: You can combine multiple strategies using functions like `one_of()`, `both()`, and `either()`. For example, `one_of(integers(), floats())` will generate either an integer or a float.

Remember that Hypothesis is designed to find minimal failing examples, so it will try to shrink the size and complexity of failing test cases. If you need your test data to be of a certain size or complexity, it's usually best to specify that using the methods described above.

## Default Generators

In Hypothesis for Python, what are the limitations of default generators?

Hypothesis for Python provides a wide range of built-in strategies (generators) for creating test data. However, there are some limitations:

1. **Complexity of Data**: The built-in strategies are great for generating simple types of data, but for more complex or specific types of data, you may need to define your own custom strategies. For example, if you need to generate instances of a custom class, or data that satisfies specific constraints, you will need to define a custom strategy.

2. **Control Over Data Distribution**: Hypothesis does not provide direct control over the distribution of generated data. It's designed to find edge cases and will try to generate data that is likely to cause your tests to fail. If you need more control over the distribution of your test data, you may need to define a custom strategy.

3. **Size and Complexity of Generated Data**: By default, Hypothesis tries to find the smallest and simplest failing example. This means it will often generate small and simple data. If you need your test data to be of a certain size or complexity, you will need to specify that in your strategy.

4. **Stateful Testing**: While Hypothesis does support stateful testing, setting up stateful tests can be complex and requires a good understanding of how Hypothesis works.

5. **Performance**: Generating complex data or a large number of examples can be slow. This can be mitigated by careful design of your strategies and tests, and by using Hypothesis's features for controlling the number of examples generated.

Hypothesis is a tool for finding bugs, not for verifying that your code is correct. It's designed to find edge cases and unusual inputs that might cause your code to fail. It's not a replacement for other types of testing, but a complement to them.

## Generalizing Example Tests

In Hypothesis for Python, how to generalize example tests?

In Hypothesis for Python, you can generalize example tests by using property-based testing. Instead of writing tests for specific inputs and outputs, you define properties that should hold true for all inputs of a certain type, and Hypothesis generates test cases for you.

Here's how you might translate the Elixir tests you provided into Hypothesis tests in Python:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Assuming dict_gen, dict_symb, and dict_autosymb are strategies that generate dictionaries

@given(dict_gen())
def test_dict_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_symb())
def test_symbolic_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_autosymb())
def test_automated_symbolic_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5
```

In these examples, the `@given` decorator tells Hypothesis to generate test cases using the specified strategy. The test function then checks that a property holds true for the generated test case.

You need to define `dict_gen()`, `dict_symb()`, and `dict_autosymb()` strategies according to your requirements. These strategies should return a dictionary. Hypothesis provides a `dictionaries()` strategy for generating dictionaries, which you can customize to suit your needs.

Parameterized testing in Hypothesis is a way to generalize example-based tests. Instead of writing a separate test for each example, you can write a single test that takes parameters, and then use Hypothesis to generate different arguments for those parameters.

In Hypothesis, this is done using the `@given` decorator and strategies. A strategy is a description of how to generate a certain kind of data. Hypothesis provides many built-in strategies for generating common types of data, and you can also define your own strategies.

Here's how you might translate the Elixir tests you provided into parameterized tests in Hypothesis:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Assuming dict_gen, dict_symb, and dict_autosymb are strategies that generate dictionaries

@given(dict_gen())
def test_dict_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_symb())
def test_symbolic_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_autosymb())
def test_automated_symbolic_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5
```

In these examples, the `@given` decorator tells Hypothesis to generate test cases using the specified strategy. The test function then checks that a property holds true for the generated test case.

Please note that you would need to define `dict_gen()`, `dict_symb()`, and `dict_autosymb()` strategies according to your requirements. These strategies should return a dictionary. Hypothesis provides a `dictionaries()` strategy for generating dictionaries, which you can customize to suit your needs.


## Invariants

In Hypothesis for Python, how to express invariants?

In Hypothesis for Python, invariants can be expressed as properties in property-based tests. These properties are expected to hold true for all inputs of a certain type. Here's how you might express the invariants in your Elixir code as Hypothesis tests in Python:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Assuming dict_gen, dict_symb, and dict_autosymb are strategies that generate dictionaries

@given(dict_gen())
def test_dict_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_symb())
def test_symbolic_generator(d):
    # Hypothesis automatically handles evaluation of generators
    assert len(d) < 5

@given(dict_autosymb())
def test_automated_symbolic_generator(d):
    assert len(d) < 5
```

In these examples, the `@given` decorator tells Hypothesis to generate test cases using the specified strategy. The test function then checks that a property (invariant) holds true for the generated test case.

You need to define `dict_gen()`, `dict_symb()`, and `dict_autosymb()` strategies according to your requirements. These strategies should return a dictionary. Hypothesis provides a `dictionaries()` strategy for generating dictionaries, which you can customize to suit your needs.
