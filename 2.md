## Install pytest

To install `pytest` version 7.4.4 in your Python virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to your project directory where the virtual environment (`venv` or whatever name you gave it) is located.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

2. **Install pytest**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, install `pytest` version 7.4.4 using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest==7.4.4
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - After the installation, you can verify that `pytest` is installed correctly by checking its version:
     ```bash
     pytest --version
     ```
   - This command should show `pytest 7.4.4`.

4. **Using pytest**:
   - Now you can use `pytest` to run your tests. Simply navigate to the directory containing your test files and run:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   - When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

Remember, each time you want to use `pytest` for this project, make sure you activate the virtual environment first. This ensures you're using the version of `pytest` and other dependencies that are specific to this project.

## Update pip

The warning message indicates that the version of `pip` you are using in your virtual environment is outdated. To upgrade `pip` to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment**:
   - Make sure your virtual environment is activated. If it's not, navigate to your project directory and activate it:
     ```bash
     cd /Users/bparanj/work/pypbt
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Upgrade pip**:
   - Run the command provided in the warning message to upgrade `pip`:
     ```bash
     /Users/bparanj/work/pypbt/venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

3. **Verify the Upgrade**:
   - After the upgrade, you can check the version of `pip` to make sure it was successful:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
   - This should display the new version, 23.3.2, or whatever the latest version is at the time.

Upgrading `pip` is a good practice because newer versions often include improvements, bug fixes, and security enhancements. Remember to activate the relevant virtual environment before performing upgrades or installing packages to ensure that these actions are scoped to the virtual environment and not the global Python installation.
