## First pytest

Create add.py:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

Create test_add.py:

```python
from add import add

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2
```

Note: I had to remove the alias that was pointing to old version of Python to make it work with latest version of Python. Deleted alias in .zshrc.
