## Strategies

The test output shows that there are 4 tests marked as expected to fail (xfail) and 2 tests that passed. The warning message indicates that there is a use of the `@st.composite` decorator on a function that does not call the provided `draw()` function internally, which is deprecated.

To fix the tests marked as xfail, you need to remove the `@pytest.mark.xfail` decorator and then improve the filter function to make the test pass.

For the `test_filter_even_numbers` test, you can modify the filter function to only allow even numbers:

```python
@given(st.integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0))
def test_filter_even_numbers(x):
    assert str(x)[-1] in "02468"
```

For the `test_filter_odd_numbers` test, you can modify the filter function to only allow odd numbers:

```python
@given(st.integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1))
def test_filter_odd_numbers(x):
    assert str(x)[-1] in "13579"
```

Regarding the warning, you need to find the function that is using the `@st.composite` decorator but not calling the `draw()` function, and modify it to use the `draw()` function or remove the `@st.composite` decorator if it's not necessary.

The test `test_map_even_numbers` is failing because the Hypothesis library is generating all integers, including odd ones, which is causing the assertion to fail when the last digit of the integer is not even.

To fix this, you need to use the `.map()` method to transform the generated integers into even numbers before the assertion. Here's how you can do it:

```python
@given(st.integers().map(lambda x: 2 * x))
def test_map_even_numbers(x):
    # Check that last character of string x is a substring of "02468"
    assert str(x)[-1] in "02468"
```

This change should make the `test_map_even_numbers` pass. The `.map(lambda x: 2 * x)` part transforms every generated integer into an even number by multiplying it by 2.

## Recursive Strategy

Defining a recursive strategy for a `test_json_dumps` method would involve creating a strategy that can generate JSON-like data structures. JSON data structures are typically composed of dictionaries, lists, strings, integers, floats, booleans, and nulls.

Here's an example of how you can define a recursive strategy for JSON-like data structures in Python using the Hypothesis library:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

json_base = st.one_of(
    st.none(),
    st.booleans(),
    st.floats(allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False),
    st.text()
)

json_recursive = st.recursive(
    json_base,
    lambda children: st.one_of(
        st.lists(children),
        st.dictionaries(st.text(), children)
    )
)

@given(json_recursive)
def test_json_dumps(data):
    import json
    round_trip = json.loads(json.dumps(data))
    assert round_trip == data
```

In this example, `json_base` is a strategy that generates JSON base types: None, boolean, float, and string. `json_recursive` is a strategy that starts with `json_base` and adds lists and dictionaries of items drawn from `json_recursive`. This allows it to generate arbitrarily nested JSON-like data structures.

The `test_json_dumps` function then tests that `json.dumps` and `json.loads` are inverses of each other for data drawn from the `json_recursive` strategy.

## Composite Strategy

To implement a composite strategy that draws a list, determines the allowed indices, and chooses one to return, you can use the `@st.composite` decorator from the Hypothesis library. Here's an example:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@st.composite
def a_composite_strategy(draw):
    # Draw a list of integers
    lst = draw(st.lists(st.integers()))

    # Determine the allowed indices (non-empty list)
    if lst:
        allowed_indices = range(len(lst))

        # Choose one index to return
        index = draw(st.sampled_from(allowed_indices))
        return lst[index]

    return None  # Return None for empty list

@given(a_composite_strategy())
def test_composite_strategy(value):
    print(value)
```

In this example, `a_composite_strategy` is a composite strategy that first draws a list of integers. If the list is not empty, it determines the allowed indices (all indices in this case), chooses one of them, and returns the element at that index. If the list is empty, it returns `None`.

The `test_composite_strategy` function is a test that uses `a_composite_strategy` to generate test cases. It simply prints the generated value.

The error is happening because the `a_composite_strategy` function is returning `None` when the list is empty, but the test `test_a_composite_strategy` is expecting a tuple `(lst, index)`. 

To fix this, you should return a tuple `(lst, index)` in all cases in the `a_composite_strategy` function. When the list is empty or there are no positive elements, you should return `(lst, None)`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
@st.composite
def a_composite_strategy(draw):
    lst = draw(st.lists(st.integers()))
    index = None

    # Determine the allowed indices (indices of positive elements)
    allowed_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x >= 1]

    # Choose one index to return if there are any allowed indices
    if allowed_indices:
        index = draw(st.sampled_from(allowed_indices))

    return lst, index
```

In this updated version of `a_composite_strategy`, `allowed_indices` is a list of indices of positive elements in `lst`. If there are any allowed indices, one of them is chosen randomly and returned along with `lst`. If there are no allowed indices, `None` is returned as the index. This should fix the error in the `test_a_composite_strategy` test.
