There are several static type checkers for Python that serve a similar purpose to Dialyzer in Elixir. One of the most popular is Mypy.

Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing. Mypy was created by Jukka Lehtosalo as part of his PhD thesis in 2013, and it's now maintained by a team of volunteers, including Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.

Here's an example of how you might use Mypy:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello, ' + name

greet(123)  # This will raise a type error
```

In this example, the `greet` function is annotated to indicate that it takes a string as an argument and returns a string. If you try to call `greet` with an integer, Mypy will raise a type error.

To use Mypy, you'll need to install it (for example, with `pip install mypy`), and then you can run it on your Python files with the `mypy` command.

Please note that Mypy checks types statically, before the code is run, and it doesn't affect the runtime behavior of the code. This is different from some other type systems, which check types at runtime.
